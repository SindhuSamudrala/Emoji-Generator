# Emoji-Generator
Using Convolution Neural Network to recognize facial emotions and mapping facial expressions with the emojis which is one of the important Deep Learning techniques we learned in this course. Throughout this project we will show how we have implemented different tools and techniques such as Data Preprocessing, Data Augmentation, Image Classification, Sequential Modelling techniques and hyper parameter tuning such as number of dropouts, ideal learning rate, number of CNN hidden layers, feature extraction techniques, as well as implementation of pretrained models using transfer learning. After developing two models,selected the best of them by comparing accuracies to integrate with GUI to detect emotion in live videos.
